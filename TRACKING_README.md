## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
wp-content/plugins/service-requests/
â”œâ”€â”€ includes/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ class-sr-frontend.php    # Shortcode rendering
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ class-sr-ajax.php        # AJAX handlers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ class-sr-db.php          # Database operations
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js/sr-form.js            # JavaScript functionality
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ css/sr-form.css          # Styling
â””â”€â”€ tracking-demo.html           # Demo page
```

### Database Schema
The tracking system uses the existing `service_requests` table with these key fields:
- `id`: Confirmation number (auto-increment primary key)
- `pin_hash`: Hashed PIN for security
- `status`: Current request status
- `created_at`: Submission timestamp
- Additional fields for request details

### AJAX Endpoints
- `sr_track_request`: Handles tracking form submissions

## Customization

### Custom Styling
Add custom CSS to override default styles:

```css
.sr-tracking {
    /* Your custom styles */
}

.status-badge {
    /* Custom status badge styles */
}
```

### Custom Status Values
Update the status handling in `class-sr-ajax.php` to support additional status types.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Security check failed"**
- Ensure WordPress nonces are properly configured
- Check that AJAX requests include the security token

**"No service request found"**
- Verify the confirmation number is correct
- Check that the request exists in the database

**"Invalid PIN"**
- Ensure the PIN matches the one created during submission
- PINs are case-sensitive and must be 4-6 digits

### Error Logging
Enable WordPress debugging to see detailed error messages:

```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```

## Development

### Adding New Features
The tracking system is modular and can be extended:

1. **Custom Fields**: Add new fields to the tracking display in `class-sr-frontend.php`
2. **Status Types**: Extend status handling in `class-sr-ajax.php`
3. **Validation**: Add custom validation rules in the JavaScript file
4. **Styling**: Extend the CSS for custom appearance

### Testing
Use the included `tracking-demo.html` file to test the interface design before implementing in WordPress.
